# FARMER'S MARKET #
## Drupal :droplet: 8 User Guide ##
Conceptual example given in [the Drupal 8 User Guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/index.html) for a farmer's market website built with Drupal 8.

Apart from the website, this repository will also serve as my "plain-speak" notes on the various workings of the Drupal 8 CMS.
